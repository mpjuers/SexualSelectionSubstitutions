Guillaume’s summary of October 7th 2020 phone conversation with Mark, to write down Mark’s ideas.

In regards to Leonie’s comment about female choice and how the Kirkpatrick model doesn’t include it;
It would be really interesting to use our method to estimate the selection coefficient under Fisherian selection with the ones under a female benefit scenario.

It would strengthen our paper if we can speak to runaway sexual selection.

Perhaps we can find mentions of the difference in coefficient of selection for the two types of sexual selection.
